        How to use: 
      </b>
    </div>
    <div>
      Simply splash your face with water, wet one side of the pad, and glide over your face to activate a light cleansing cream that can be gently worked into the skin and rinsed away. Remove light eye makeup by sweeping the wet cleansing wipe over your eyelids and rinsing away to gently rub away mascara. Cleansing complete, you can then finish your routine as usual.
